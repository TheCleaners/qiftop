# AGENTS.md — qiftop developer & contributor guide

A living document for humans and LLM-driven agents working on qiftop. Keep
each change in lock-step with the code so it stays usable. If you change a
public type, a build invariant, or a layering rule, update the relevant
section in the same commit.

## 1. What is qiftop?

`qiftop` is a Qt 6 iftop-style Linux network monitor. It ships as two
Debian packages built from this single tree:

| Package        | Binary           | Privilege               | Talks to                                     |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `qiftop`       | `qiftop`         | Unprivileged GUI client | `qiftop-agent` over DBus (system or session) |
| `qiftop-agent` | `qiftop-agent`   | `CAP_NET_ADMIN` daemon  | Linux kernel (libnl-3, libnetfilter_conntrack) |

The agent is the only component that touches the kernel. The GUI is a pure
DBus consumer (with optional self-elevation as a fallback when the agent
isn't installed). DNS resolution and any other "soft" enrichment happens
strictly client-side.

### Layering rules

1. **`backend/` does not include `agent/` or `ui/` or `dbus/Types.h`.**
   Backends speak in their own value types (`InterfaceStats`, `Connection`).
   The agent translates them to DTOs at the boundary.
2. **`agent/` does not include `ui/`.** Period.
3. **`ui/` does not include `backend/linux/*`.** It uses the abstract
   interfaces (resolved at runtime to either a `DBus*Monitor` or, when
   self-elevated, the platform monitor).
4. **`dbus/Types.h` is the wire contract.** Changing it is a breaking change
   for every installed client; bump a version or add a new method.
5. **`util/`, `dbus/`, and `backend/` (excluding `backend/dbus/` which is
   client-side) must not include from `ui/` or depend on Qt Widgets.**
   These directories — plus the pure-logic headers under `ui/` like
   `util/ConnectionHeuristics.h` — are the future `libqiftop` material
   (see §10). Anything pulling in `QWidget`, `QAbstract*Model`,
   `QSortFilterProxyModel`, or similar belongs in `ui/`.
6. **No platform headers outside `backend/<os>/` or `backend/PlatformInfo.cpp`.**
   `<linux/*>`, `<sys/un.h>`, `<netinet/*>`, `<ifaddrs.h>`, `<windows.h>`,
   `<sys/sysctl.h>` etc. live in the platform subdirectory's translation
   units, or behind `qiftop::platform` (with documented fallbacks on
   unsupported OSes). Code in `agent/`, `ui/`, `dns/`, `config/`,
   `dbus/` and the abstract `backend/*.h` interfaces must compile on
   any Qt 6 target. See `docs/PORTABILITY.md` for the full survey of
   what each target OS would need.

### Future direction (long-term)

The current binary split (`qiftop` GUI + `qiftop-agent` daemon) is
expected to grow a third component: **`libqiftop`**, a Qt6::Core-only
shared library carrying the DTOs, aggregation/EMA helpers, filter
mini-language, and unit formatters. Planned consumers beyond the Qt
GUI: a Prometheus-style metrics exporter, an alerting daemon, and
possibly an ncurses frontend. This is **not v0.1 work**, but two
things follow now:

* The DBus contract is effectively a public ABI for those future
  consumers — treat DTO breakage as a multi-frontend cost, not just
  a GUI cost.
* Resist any change that tightens Widgets coupling in `util/`,
  `dbus/`, `backend/`, or the pure-logic headers under `ui/`. If you
  catch yourself reaching for `QAbstractItemModel` in a utility,
  that's a smell — the model should wrap a plain `QObject`
  aggregator, not be the aggregator.

## 3. Build, run, package

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Run the agent against the session bus (no root needed, conntrack will warn)
./build/qiftop-agent --session --verbose -c dist/conf/agent.conf

# Run the GUI
./build/qiftop

# Build both .debs
cd build && cpack -G DEB
```

CPack quirk worth remembering: component-specific keys use the **upper-cased
component name verbatim, hyphens kept literal** —
`CPACK_DEBIAN_QIFTOP-AGENT_PACKAGE_*`.

---

## 4. The DBus contract

Well-known name: `org.qiftop.NetworkAgent1` (system bus in production;
`--session` for development).

| Object path                                  | Interface                                  | Methods                                                   | Signals                                                | Properties                  |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `/org/qiftop/NetworkAgent1/Interfaces`       | `org.qiftop.NetworkAgent1.Interfaces`      | `GetInterfaces()`, `SetDesiredIntervalMs(u)`              | `StatsChanged(t, a(...))`, `CadenceChanged(u)`         | `Version: s`, `Capabilities: as` |
| `/org/qiftop/NetworkAgent1/Connections`      | `org.qiftop.NetworkAgent1.Connections`     | `GetConnections()`, `SetDesiredIntervalMs(u)`             | `ConnectionsChanged(t, a(...))`, `PermissionDenied`, `AccountingChanged` | |

Both data signals carry a leading `quint64 monotonicMs` (a
`QElapsedTimer`-based, agent-process-local monotonic millisecond
counter) sampled at the moment the snapshot was serialised. This is
the canonical timestamp for downstream rate computation (libqiftop
history, Prometheus exporter, alerts): it's immune to wall-clock
jumps and to DBus delivery jitter. It is NOT comparable across agent
restarts.

DTOs live in `src/dbus/Types.h`.

**Connection wire signature** (15 fields per flow):
`a(yysqysqttttsyuy)` =
`(proto, localFamily, localAddress, localPort, remoteFamily, remoteAddress,
remotePort, rxBytes, txBytes, rxPackets, txPackets, iface, direction,
ifIndex, tcpState)`.

**InterfaceStats wire signature** (16 fields per row):
`(ssusasttttbbuytttt)` =
`(name, type, mtu, addresses, rxBytes, txBytes, rxPackets, txPackets,
isUp, isLoopback, ifIndex, operState, rxErrors, txErrors, rxDropped,
txDropped)`.

Per-field notes:

* `proto` — **IANA L4 number** (RFC 5237): TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1,
  ICMPv6=58, Unknown=0. See `toIanaProto` / `fromIanaProto` in
  `src/backend/Connection.h`. Capability: `iana-proto`.
* `direction` — `0=Unknown / 1=Outbound / 2=Inbound`. Computed
  server-side via `qiftop::heuristics::inferDirection`. Clients SHOULD
  trust non-zero values and fall back to a local heuristic only when
  the wire says `Unknown` (true today for in-process / handoff
  backends). `fromDto` clamps out-of-range values to `Unknown` rather
  than `static_cast`-ing them (UB-safe against buggy/future agents).
  Capability: `direction-on-wire`.
* `ifIndex` — Kernel ifindex matching `iface` / `name`. Prefer this
  over the iface name string for stable identity (names can be reused
  across netns; ifindex cannot within a single namespace). 0 = unknown
  or unattributed. Capability: `ifindex`.
* `operState` — Linux `IF_OPER_*` (RFC 2863): 0 UNKNOWN, 1 NOTPRESENT,
  2 DOWN, 3 LOWERLAYERDOWN, 4 TESTING, 5 DORMANT, 6 UP. Distinguishes
  "admin up but link not up" from "admin down" — the simple `isUp`
  bool only tells you about IFF_UP (admin). Capability: `oper-state`.
* `tcpState` — Conntrack TCP state (`TCP_CONNTRACK_*` per
  `<linux/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp.h>`): 0 NONE, 1 SYN_SENT, 2
  SYN_RECV, 3 ESTABLISHED, 4 FIN_WAIT, 5 CLOSE_WAIT, 6 LAST_ACK, 7
  TIME_WAIT, 8 CLOSE, 9 SYN_SENT2. Non-TCP flows always report 0.
  `fromDto` clamps unknown values to NONE. Capability: `tcp-state`.
* `rxErrors` / `txErrors` / `rxDropped` / `txDropped` — Cumulative
  kernel counters via libnl `RTNL_LINK_RX/TX_ERRORS / RX/TX_DROPPED`.
  Useful for surfacing flaky NICs and tight-budget tunnels. Capability:
  `link-errors`.

### Contract version & capabilities

`Version` is a free-form string (currently `"0.3"`) bumped only for
*additive* changes to the agent surface that clients may care about.
**Breaking** changes (DTO signature, method removal/rename) still require
a fresh `org.qiftop.NetworkAgent2` interface per §8.

> Historical note: the 0.1 → 0.2 bump (pre-release v0.1-alpha2 →
> alpha3) reshaped the wire (added `direction` byte, switched `proto`
> to IANA, PascalCased `AccountingChanged`). The 0.2 → 0.3 bump
> (alpha3 → tag tbd) extended both DTOs and added a `monotonicMs`
> leading arg to both data signals. Since only pre-release alphas
> existed in either window we reshaped in place rather than branching
> `NetworkAgent2`. Older alpha clients failing to unmarshal fall back
> cleanly to the in-process backend via the existing probe. Post-v0.1
> stable release, breaking changes MUST go through `NetworkAgent2`.

`Capabilities` is a `QStringList` of dash-separated lowercase tokens.
Clients gate optional behaviour on token presence — never on a Version
comparison — and treat absence as "off" so they keep working against
older agents. Tokens currently emitted:

| Token                 | Meaning                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cadence-hints`       | `SetDesiredIntervalMs` is honoured (vs. ignored).           |
| `cadence-signal`      | `CadenceChanged` fires on effective-cadence changes.        |
| `name-owner-cleanup`  | Hints dropped on `NameOwnerChanged` (peer disconnect).      |
| `monotonic-clock`     | Hint TTL uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (immune to wall-clock jumps). |
| `snapshot-cap`        | `ConnectionsChanged` payload is capped at top-N by bytes.   |
| `iana-proto`          | `ConnectionDto.proto` is an IANA number (RFC 5237), not the internal enum index. |
| `direction-on-wire`   | `ConnectionDto.direction` is populated server-side; clients can skip the heuristic when non-zero. |
| `snapshot-timestamp`  | `StatsChanged` / `ConnectionsChanged` prefix the payload with a CLOCK_MONOTONIC ms counter. |
| `ifindex`             | `InterfaceStatsDto.ifIndex` and `ConnectionDto.ifIndex` populated. |
| `oper-state`          | `InterfaceStatsDto.operState` populated with `IF_OPER_*` per RFC 2863. |
| `link-errors`         | `InterfaceStatsDto` carries `rxErrors` / `txErrors` / `rxDropped` / `txDropped`. |
| `tcp-state`           | `ConnectionDto.tcpState` populated for TCP flows.           |
| `process-attribution` | Resolver chain provides per-flow PID / comm / uid (Linux `SockDiagResolver`). UI-visible once `ConnectionDtoV2` lands. |
| `container-attribution` | Resolver chain provides per-PID container runtime + id + name (Linux `CgroupClassifier`). |
| `netns-scan`          | Resolver chain dumps sock_diag in every non-host network namespace (Linux `NetnsScanner`, requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`). |

Add a token here when shipping a new optional behaviour; **never remove
or rename a token** — pre-existing clients use them as feature flags.

### Wire-contract wisdom

Lessons accumulated across the v0.1 contract reviews (#1 and #2). When
designing or extending any DBus method/signal/DTO, prefer these defaults
over re-deriving them each time:

* **Don't ship internal enum *indices* across the wire.** Use an
  external, stable encoding (IANA numbers, IETF RFCs, kernel UAPI
  values) so non-Qt consumers don't need to mirror our private
  `enum class` declarations. The 0.1 wire shipped `L4Proto` indices
  (TCP=1); the 0.2 wire ships IANA numbers (TCP=6). The latter is
  recoverable by anyone with an RFC 5237 lookup; the former required
  reading our header.
* **Clamp every wire-sourced enum on the receive path.** Use a range
  check + fallback to a known-safe value instead of `static_cast<E>(x)`
  when `x` comes from a peer process. UB on the receiver from a
  malicious or future-extended sender is otherwise free. See
  `fromDto`'s direction/tcpState clamps.
* **Append-only struct fields.** DBus struct sigs hash the field list;
  reordering or removing breaks every subscriber. Always add new
  fields at the END of the DTO. The `<<`/`>>` operators must list
  fields in declaration order; mismatch = silent off-by-one on the
  wire.
* **Capability tokens are append-only too.** Once a token is shipped,
  it must keep its name forever (clients use presence as a feature
  flag). Add new tokens for new behaviour; never delete or rename.
* **Tokens advertise BEHAVIOUR, not version.** `cadence-hints` means
  "the agent honours hints", not "agent ≥ 0.1". Clients should always
  branch on token presence, never on `Version` comparison.
* **Snapshot signals should carry their own timestamp.** Receipt time
  on the client is noisy (DBus delivery jitter, GC pauses, UI
  hangs). Sample the timestamp at the producer at serialise time.
  Use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (or `QElapsedTimer::elapsed()`) not wall
  clock — wall-clock jumps WILL corrupt rate calculations the moment
  NTP or systemd-timesyncd nudges the clock.
* **Cap snapshot payloads at the producer.** On a busy router
  conntrack can hold 100 k+ flows; a 10 MB DBus message every second
  hurts both sides and `m_last` will pin the high-water mark for the
  life of the process. Sort by importance, truncate, log a `qWarning`.
* **Server-side enrichment beats client-side enrichment for shared
  derivations.** Direction inference and ifindex lookup both used to
  be (or would have been) client-side; moving them server-side
  means each new frontend (libqiftop, exporter, TUI) doesn't have
  to reimplement them. The cost is one inferDirection call per
  capped flow per tick — trivial compared to the conntrack dump
  itself.
* **Stable identity ≠ display name.** Always ship the kernel index
  (ifindex) alongside the human name (ifname). Names get reused
  across netns; indices don't within one namespace.
* **Pre-release breaking changes are cheap; post-release ones are
  not.** While only `vX.Y-alphaN` tags exist publicly, reshape the
  wire freely and bump the additive `Version` field. After the first
  stable tag, breaking changes MUST branch a new interface name
  (`NetworkAgent2`) and keep `NetworkAgent1` alive for at least one
  release.
* **Bump `Version` AND add a capability token for every additive
  change.** Version tells the user which agent build they're talking
  to; the capability token is what clients actually branch on.
  Different jobs, both required.
* **The wire schema lives in two places** — `src/dbus/Types.{h,cpp}`
  (the C++ source of truth) and `AGENTS.md §4` (the human-readable
  contract). They drift trivially. Update both in the same commit, or
  the next contract review wastes time re-discovering the drift (we
  did, in review #2: the signature string was `(yysqysqtttts)` —
  only 12 type chars — while the prose claimed 13 named fields).

### Bounded payloads

`ConnectionsService` caps each emitted `ConnectionsChanged` snapshot at
**4096 flows**, sorted by `bytes_in + bytes_out` (top talkers). When the
kernel table is larger, the agent logs a `qWarning` and truncates; the
GUI never has to deal with a million-row table. The cap is a compile-time
constant in `src/agent/ConnectionsService.cpp` — bump it (and the §4
contract note) if a real use case appears.

### Access control

The system-bus policy (`dist/dbus/org.qiftop.NetworkAgent1.conf`) restricts
all method calls and signal reception to members of the `netdev` group.
This closes two issues that the previous "any local user" policy left
open:

* **CPU/netlink amplification DoS.** Any caller could pin the root agent
  at `poll.min_interval_ms` (100 ms) indefinitely by re-asserting a
  cadence hint every few seconds. Each hint also called `noteActivity()`,
  so the IdleManager never wound down.
* **Information disclosure.** `GetConnections()` returns the full
  conntrack table — every flow on the host, including other users'
  source ports and peer IPs. `/proc/net/nf_conntrack` is root-only on
  most distros; the agent must not demote that.

`dist/debian/postinst` ensures the `netdev` group exists and, when
installed via `sudo apt install` / `pkexec`, automatically adds the
invoking user (`$SUDO_USER` / `$PKEXEC_UID`) to it. Users still need to
log out and back in (or run `newgrp netdev`) for the new group
membership to take effect. The GUI's
`probeAgent()` does a real `GetInterfaces` call with a 1 s timeout (and
opportunistically reads `Version` / `Capabilities`), so users without
group access fall back cleanly to the in-process (self-elevated) backend
rather than seeing an empty UI. The active mode is shown in the GUI
status bar (`agent <version>` vs. `in-process`).

When adding a new method, no XML edit is required — the group gate
applies at the interface level. If a specific method needs a stricter
gate (e.g. an admin-only setter), add a `<deny send_member="…"/>` to
the default policy and a matching `<allow>` to the privileged stanza.

### Cadence control

* The agent has a built-in baseline cadence (`poll.base_interval_ms`, 1 s).
* Any client may call `SetDesiredIntervalMs(uint ms)` on either service to
  request a faster cadence. The agent uses `min()` across all live hints,
  clamped to `poll.min_interval_ms` (100 ms by default).
* Hints expire after `idle.hint_ttl_secs` (default 10 s). Clients should
  re-assert at ~half-TTL while they want the boost. There is no
  `NameOwnerChanged` plumbing — TTL handles disconnects.
* If no method calls arrive for `idle.timeout_secs`, polling is paused
  entirely (no signals, near-zero CPU). The first incoming call wakes it.
* Setting any window or `idle.timeout_secs` to `0` disables that step
  (the comparison is guarded; see `IdleManager::evaluate`). This matches
  what `dist/conf/agent.conf` has always documented.

---

## 5. Configuration

`/etc/qiftop/agent.conf` — INI parsed by `QSettings(IniFormat)`, read once
at startup. See the shipped file (`dist/conf/agent.conf`) for the
authoritative documentation of every key. Marked as a Debian conffile so
user edits survive package upgrades.

Every parsed value is routed through a `clampCfg()` helper that bounds it
to a sensible range and emits a `qWarning()` if the file value is out of
range (intervals: `[10 ms, 1 h]`; windows/timeouts: `[0, 24 h]`, with `0`
meaning "disable that step"). Typos in the conffile produce a visible
warning, not a degenerate cadence.

Override path: `qiftop-agent --config <path>`.

---

## 6. Testing strategy

Tests live in `tests/`, gated by `option(QIFTOP_BUILD_TESTS ON)` (on by
default; turn off for distro builds that don't want QtTest in the build
deps). Each test is its own executable so a single test's crash doesn't
take the rest down. Run with `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`.

Gated by `QIFTOP_BUILD_ATTRIBUTION_INTEGRATION=ON` (default OFF). |

### 6.3 Gaps worth filling

1. **`ConntrackMonitor::Worker` per-flow diff math** — once extracted
   per §6.4 #3, the diff/accounting logic can be exercised without a
   live conntrack handle.
2. **End-to-end with a real conntrack table** — requires root; needs a
   CI runner with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or a privileged container.
3. **Tier-2 attribution: more runtimes.** Docker runner is shipped
   (`tests/integration/attribution/runners/run-docker.sh`). Podman,
   k3d/k8s, and cri-o still need their own runners — the probe binary
   contract is reusable, only the bring-up scripts differ.

### 6.3a Validating against real-world container runtimes

The attribution layer's correctness depends on regex patterns matching
the EXACT paths emitted by each container runtime — and those formats
change between runtime versions, between cgroup drivers (cgroupfs vs.
systemd), and between cgroup v1 vs. v2. Untested regex drift means
silent attribution loss for users running that runtime.

**Tiered validation policy:**

1. **Tier 1 — real /proc fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/cgroup_real/` +
   `test_cgroup_real_fixtures`). Every supported runtime + driver
   combination MUST have at least one fixture sourced from authoritative
   upstream documentation or issue trackers, NOT from this developer's
   imagination. When adding or modifying a regex in `CgroupParse.h`:
     a. Find a real path example in the runtime's upstream docs (e.g.
        docs.docker.com, kubernetes.io, github.com/containers/podman,
        github.com/cri-o/cri-o, github.com/canonical/lxd).
     b. Drop it into `tests/fixtures/cgroup_real/<runtime>.txt`
        verbatim (as the file would appear in /proc).
     c. Add one row to the `classify_data()` data table.
     d. Run the test — RED first (proves the fixture really exercises
        the new regex), then green.

2. **Tier 2 — live container harness** (`tests/integration/attribution/`,
   gated by `QIFTOP_BUILD_ATTRIBUTION_INTEGRATION=ON`). The
   `qiftop-attribution-probe` binary wraps the production resolver
   factory and exposes a CLI for "given this 4-tuple, expect this
   runtime + this CID prefix". Per-runtime runner scripts under
   `runners/` bring up a real container, generate a flow, then drive
   the probe. Currently shipped: `run-docker.sh` (container→host
   outbound, exercises NetnsScanner). Not on default ctest, not on
   PR CI — only on push-to-main / release / workflow_dispatch via
   `.github/workflows/integration.yml`. Dev-box driver:
   `scripts/integration-test.sh --runtime docker`.

3. **Tier 3 — CI matrix.** Once Tier 2 exists, run it in GitHub Actions
   on every push, matrixed across `docker:latest` / `podman` / `k3d`
   / `cri-o` so upstream cgroup-path changes break a PR check, not a
   user.

When in doubt about a real-world cgroup path: consult the runtime's
upstream documentation directly. Recent successful sources used to
build the Tier 1 fixtures:
- docs.docker.com (cgroup drivers, runmetrics)
- kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-cgroup-driver/
- github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/docs/cgroup.md
- github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_cgroup_v2.md
- github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/ops.md
- kernel.org cgroup-v2.html

### 6.4 Refactors that would unblock more testing

1. ~~**Extract `loadIdleConfig` from `src/agent/main.cpp` into
   `agent/Config.{h,cpp}`**~~ **DONE** — see `src/agent/Config.{h,cpp}`,
   covered by `tests/test_agent_config.cpp`.
2. ~~**`main.cpp` glue → `qiftop::agent::Application` class.**~~ **DONE** —
   see `src/agent/Application.{h,cpp}`. RAII: ctor takes
   `QDBusConnection` + the two monitor pointers + `IdleManager::Config`;
   `start()` registers objects, requests the bus name, wires the
   IdleManager, starts monitors. Dtor unregisters + releases the name so
   the same bus can be re-used by another `Application` instance (useful
   for in-process integration tests). `main.cpp` is now a ~85-line shim.
3. **Extract `ConntrackMonitor::Worker`'s per-flow diff math** into a
   free function `computeDeltas(prev, current) -> QList<Connection>` so
   the diff/accounting tests don't need a live conntrack handle.
4. **Add `tests/fakes/FakeNetworkMonitor.{h,cpp}`** emitting canned
   `statsUpdated` signals on demand, to drive `IdleManager` and the
   services from tests.

### 6.5 CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full test suite under
`dbus-run-session` with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` on a matrix of
native ubuntu-24.04 × Debug + Release, plus a containerised matrix
(ubuntu:26.04 + fedora:44) × Debug + Release. The 26.04 slot is
containerised pending availability of a native ubuntu-26.04 GitHub
Actions runner image. `HOME` is redirected to
`$RUNNER_TEMP/home` so QSettings/Autostart tests don't trample the
runner user. See docs/HACKING.md §5.5 for the test-writing conventions.

## 7. Coding conventions

* Qt 6, C++20.
* Logging: `qCInfo(lcVerbose) << ...` (see `src/util/Logging.h`). Anything
  off the happy path goes to `qWarning()` / `qCritical()` directly.
* `QStringLiteral` only with literal tokens; for `constexpr auto kFoo = "..."`
  use `QString::fromLatin1(kFoo)`.
* DBus methods on services must be exported with
  `QDBusConnection::ExportAllContents` (we have `public slots:` methods,
  not just scriptable ones).
* `protected QDBusContext` on a service class lets you call
  `calledFromDBus() / message().service()` to get the caller's unique name.
* Backend `setPollIntervalMs(int ms)` semantics: `ms <= 0` means "pause the
  timer, emit nothing"; positive values set the interval and (re)start.
* **Privilege escalation env handling.** `src/util/PrivilegeEscalator.cpp`
  uses an **allowlist** (`sessionEnv()`) when forwarding environment
  variables into the privileged child, not a denylist. The root child runs
  with `AT_SECURE` unset, so ld.so honours `LD_PRELOAD` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  / `LD_AUDIT` / `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` etc. from whatever environment it sees;
  a denylist would always lose this race against new loader knobs. If a
  helper needs a new env var to work, add it to `kAllow` explicitly and
  audit whether an attacker could weaponise it. The same allowlist is
  applied to every QProcess we spawn (not just pkexec) via
  `scrubbedHelperEnv()` so that kdesu / gksudo / lxqt-sudo / beesu can't
  pass through hostile env vars either. **`PATH` is deliberately NOT on
  the allowlist** — both `sessionEnv()` and `scrubbedHelperEnv()` force
  `PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` to keep the privileged child safe
  from any future relative-path exec resolving through a user-controlled
  directory (LPE primitive). Pinned by `test_priv_escalator`.
* **Handoff IPC hardening.** `HandoffServer` (parent ↔ privileged child
  IPC) enforces several invariants worth keeping intact:
    - Socket lives under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (mode 0700, kernel-managed)
      or, when that's missing, a freshly `mkdtemp`'d 0700 directory under
      `$HOME/.cache/qiftop/handoff-XXXXXX/`. **Never `/tmp`** — `bind()`
      in a world-writable directory leaves a permission-race window.
    - Every accepted peer must pass `SO_PEERCRED` (uid matches parent
      or is 0). Defence-in-depth on top of the 0600 socket mode.
    - The 256-bit auth nonce is written to a 0600 file and the *path*
      is forwarded via `QIFTOP_HANDOFF_NONCE_FILE`. **Never put the
      nonce on argv** — `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is world-readable for the
      lifetime of the pkexec prompt. The child reads + unlinks
      immediately.
    - An unauthenticated incumbent peer is evicted in favour of a
      newcomer, so a same-uid process can't camp the slot pre-HELLO.
      Once authenticated the slot is sticky.
    - Read buffers are capped: 1 KiB pre-auth, 1 MiB post-auth.
    - Pinned by `test_handoff_auth`.
* **CSV / spreadsheet injection.** `src/util/Exporter.cpp::csvSanitise`
  prepends a leading apostrophe to any field starting with `=`, `+`, `-`,
  `@`, `\t`, or `\r` before quoting. Attacker-controlled hostnames (via
  reverse DNS) or interface names from the kernel must not be able to
  execute as spreadsheet formulas when the user opens an exported CSV.
* **`IdleManager::setClientHint` returns `bool`.** Services should only
  call `noteActivity()` on accepted hints — otherwise a peer rejected
  from the (capped) hint table can still pin the agent out of idle by
  hammering `SetDesiredIntervalMs`. Pinned by `test_idle`.

---

## 8. Release / versioning

* `project(... VERSION 0.1)` in `CMakeLists.txt` is the single source of
  truth. Both .debs and the `CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION` derive from it.
* The DBus interface name (`org.qiftop.NetworkAgent1`) carries the
  contract version. **If you make a breaking change to a DTO or to a
  method signature, bump to `NetworkAgent2` and keep the old one alive
  for one release.**
* User-facing config (`/etc/qiftop/agent.conf`) is a conffile — additions
  are fine, removals/renames are not. Always keep loader code tolerant
  of unknown keys.

## 8a. Lifetime & races in process / container attribution

Process and container attribution (`ProcessResolver` and its
implementations under `src/backend/linux/`) chase information that the
kernel can invalidate at any moment: processes exit, fds close, cgroups
get removed, network namespaces get destroyed. Every resolver MUST treat
those as the normal case and degrade silently rather than crash, spam
the log, or — worst — return *wrong* attribution.

Concrete rules every resolver must follow:

1. **All `/proc/<pid>/*` reads tolerate ENOENT / EACCES.** Any open or
   readlink that races a vanishing process returns `nullopt`, not an
   error. No `qWarning` on these — they happen every second on a busy
   host and would drown the log. (See SockDiagResolver's
   `refreshProcWalk`: `opendir`/`readlink` failures just `continue`.)

2. **PID reuse is guarded by starttime.** PIDs wrap on busy hosts (and
   on hosts with `kernel.pid_max=32768` they wrap fast). Any cache or
   late-bound lookup that maps `pid → info` MUST snapshot
   `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 (starttime in jiffies-since-boot) at
   enrollment time and re-check on use. A mismatch means the kernel has
   handed that pid to a different process; the cached attribution is
   stale and MUST be discarded, not served. See
   `backend/linux/ProcSnapshot.h::pidStartTime` and its use in
   `SockDiagResolver::resolveFlow` + `CgroupClassifier::resolveContainerForPid`.

3. **Cached "info is unknown" is fine.** When the underlying file
   disappears, caching `nullopt` keyed by (pid, starttime) for the TTL
   is correct: short-lived processes don't deserve repeated /proc
   churn, and the entry will age out naturally.

4. **Container names are display strings, not handles.** A
   `ContainerInfo{runtime, id, name}` returned to the GUI may refer to
   a cgroup that has since been deleted (container stopped). That's
   fine — we display the snapshot we took. Never re-resolve "live" from
   a cached id without going back through the resolver chain (which
   re-snapshots starttime + cgroup path).

5. **Namespace operations (step 4 — NetnsScanner) must be RAII-fenced.**
   The pattern, when implemented:
     - Open `/proc/<pid>/ns/net` with `O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC`. ENOENT →
       skip this pid silently.
     - `fstat()` the fd; the `st_ino` uniquely identifies the netns.
       Dedupe scans by inode so multiple pids in the same container
       cost one dump.
     - Capture the worker thread's *original* netns fd FIRST. Wrap the
       `setns()` + dump + `setns(back)` sequence in a scope guard whose
       destructor restores the original netns. **If the restore
       `setns()` ever fails, `qFatal`** — we're stuck running future
       sock_diag dumps in the wrong netns and would attribute every
       host flow to the wrong container.
     - The dump itself running in a since-destroyed netns returns
       ENETUNREACH or empty results; treat as "no flows", not an error.
     - All of this happens on the agent's worker thread so the main
       thread is never affected.

6. **No `int`-returning syscalls without checking errno.** Anything
   that can fail (socket, bind, sendto, recv, opendir, setns,
   readlink, openat) must either bail out cleanly or log via
   `qCWarning(lcVerbose)` exactly ONCE per cycle — not per failure.

7. **Resolver methods must be safe to call from the data-emission
   loop.** That loop has a per-tick budget; resolvers are NOT allowed
   to do unbounded I/O or block on external services. The `kCacheTtlMs`
   constants in each resolver are the contract: refresh costs amortise
   to roughly once per TTL per pid, never per flow.

8. **Bounded caches, hard cap, clear-on-overflow.** Every per-pid cache
   has an upper bound (e.g. `CgroupClassifier::kCacheMaxItems = 8192`).
   On overflow, full-clear rather than LRU-evict — at this scale the
   complexity isn't justified and the next tick repopulates the hot
   set. **Never** let the cache grow unbounded; a host with 100 k
   short-lived workers per minute would OOM the agent otherwise.

Unit coverage of the race surface lives in `tests/test_proc_snapshot.cpp`
(parser robustness + live self-pid stability) and the existing resolver
unit tests; for end-to-end "actually races a dying process" coverage we
rely on the integration test running under `dbus-run-session`.

When adding a new resolver: re-read this section, then ask yourself
"what happens if every /proc/<pid>/* file I touch returns ENOENT?" If
the answer is anything other than "the resolver returns nullopt and the
caller carries on", the design is wrong.

## 9. Keeping this document fresh

This file describes the *current* state of the codebase — architecture,
contracts, layering rules, conventions. It is **not** a changelog;
`git log` is. Earlier revisions of AGENTS.md kept a hand-maintained
list of dated entries at the bottom, which inevitably drifted out of
sync with reality. That list has been removed; use `git log -- AGENTS.md`
(or `git log -p -- AGENTS.md`) to see how the doc evolved.

When you make a non-trivial change to the codebase:

* Update the relevant section above so it still describes how the code
  actually works. Same commit as the code change.
* If the change affects a dev-loop recipe (build, run, debug, package,
  test), update [docs/HACKING.md](docs/HACKING.md) too.
* Don't add a dated entry here — the commit message and `git log` are
  the canonical record.

Things that almost always need an AGENTS.md edit:

* New or renamed DBus method / signal / object path → §4.
* New config key → §5 (and `dist/conf/agent.conf`).
* New backend or platform → §2 + §7's "Adding a New Platform Backend".
* New layering boundary or violation fix → §2 "Layering rules".
* New test or test infrastructure → §6.
* Breaking change to a public type or the wire format → §8 (bump
  contract version), plus the relevant DTO docs in §4.
